Kasper Emil Thorvaldsen made the original text based game in 2018. Anders Ulfsnes used the ideas from Kaspers game, and made a GUI-version (graphic user interface)
using PyQt and Qt Designer. This was done during the summer of 2019, and continued in the summer of 2020. 


Networking is implemented using Socket
Since the network communication is socket based the players and host has to be connected to the same router
